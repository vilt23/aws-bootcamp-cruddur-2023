### Backend Containerization

#### I started by creating a docker file for backend flask app in the backend folder. I named the file [DockerFile](https://github.com/vilt23/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/backend-flask/Dockerfile) 
I install the requirements for flask using the command: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
