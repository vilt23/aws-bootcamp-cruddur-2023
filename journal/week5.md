# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching



I started by re organizing the bash script in the bin folder of the backend. I created 3 folders: the rds folder containg the update-sg-rule script, the db folder containing the postgres scripts and ddb folder where I will place the dynamoDB scripts. I also rename of the previous scrpits and modify their paths in the setup script and the gitpod.yml file.
